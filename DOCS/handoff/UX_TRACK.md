# UX/UI Track — execution log

A running, evidence-first record of the UX/UI overhaul. Each sub-phase is a single section: what shipped, why, file inventory, gate results. Append-only; do not edit closed sub-phases.

**Track scope:** UX-1 Foundation → UX-2 Mobile refactor of 6 dense surfaces → UX-3 A11y baseline → UX-4 Visual polish → UX-5 iOS prep (PWA + bridging foundations).

**Locked product decisions (2026-05-20):**
1. Mobile bottom tabs: Overview / Decision / Replay / Paper + "More"
2. Accept = visible button only — no swipe (per NN/g contextual-swipe guidance)
3. Disclaimer = first-launch modal + persistent footer (continues MVP-5 pattern)
4. iOS path = PWA first; native Swift deferred to a later track

**Operating contract:**
- Auto commit + push after gates green
- Sub-phase reporting to user; no per-commit approval gates
- All existing gates (pytest, ruff, mypy, tsc, vitest, build, playwright) preserved
- New gates added progressively: multi-viewport playwright, visual regression, axe-core, touch-target lint, font-size lint, Lighthouse mobile

## UX-1.1 — viewport meta + mobile-first CSS baseline
**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Commit:** `d0c85e3`
**Status:** Closed

### What shipped
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` — added Next.js `viewport` export with `width=device-width`, `initialScale=1`, `viewportFit=cover`, themeColor for light + dark.
- `frontend/src/app/globals.css`:
  - `html { -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; text-size-adjust: 100% }` blocks iOS Safari paragraph auto-zoom.
  - `body { -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; overscroll-behavior-y: contain }` kills the tap-gray-flash and the rubber-band scroll bounce.
  - `@media (max-width: 767px) { input, select, textarea { font-size: 16px } }` blocks iOS focus-zoom on inputs (Safari's hard rule: <16px triggers zoom).
  - `.safe-area-{pt,pb,pl,pr}` utilities reading `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notch / home-indicator awareness.
- `.gitignore` — added `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) — allowlists `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` for research agents on this project.

### Why
The audit (score 2/10) flagged "no viewport meta" as the single highest-impact issue: iPhone Safari was rendering this app at desktop scale, leaving every user zoomed-out by default. Forcing input font-size ≥ 16px on mobile prevents the disorienting zoom-on-focus that fintech apps consistently get flagged for in usability research. Safe-area utilities are prerequisite for the bottom-sheet ContextPane and bottom-tab nav coming in UX-1.3 and UX-2.

### Gates
| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| tsc --noEmit | clean |
| vitest | 13 passed (4 files) |
| next build | 17 routes static (unchanged: `/universe` still ships) |
| playwright chromium | 10 passed |

### Out of scope (deferred)
- Actual mobile drawer for the sidebar — UX-1.2
- ContextPane → bottom sheet — UX-1.3
- Tailwind token fixes (`bg-canvas-elevated` etc.) — UX-1.4
- Touch target audit — UX-1.5
